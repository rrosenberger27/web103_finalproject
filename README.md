## About

### Description and Purpose

[In touch is a social media platform purposed towards helping user's to manage the connections that are valuable to them and remember to stay in touch. The app is built with the goal to drive user's to reach out to people they might not have conversed with recently and maintain their meaningful connections]

### Inspiration

[The inspiration is rooted in the fact that, from getting bogged down with things like school and work, we can often forget to connect with people who are important to us and lose touch. By creating a platform focused towards resolving this, we can hold onto our connections and not forget to reach out]
