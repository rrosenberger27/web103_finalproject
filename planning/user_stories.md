## Draft User Stories

1. As a [user role], I want to [what], so that [why].

1. Account Creation
As a user, I want to sign up with my email and password,
so that I can create my own space to manage personal connections.

2. Secure Login
As a user, I want to log in securely with my credentials,
so that I can access my connections and personal data safely.

3. Profile Personalization
As a user, I want to edit my profile and upload a profile picture,
so that my connections can recognize me and I can express my personality.

4. Adding a New Connection
As someone trying to nurture my network,
I want to add a new person to my list of connections,
so that I can remember to stay in touch with them in the future.

5. Seeing My Connections Visually
As a user who likes to visualize my social circle,
I want to see all my connections displayed on a map,
so that I can better understand where the people in my life are and how we’re all connected.

6. Setting How Often I Reach Out
As someone who wants to be intentional about communication,
I want to choose how often I get reminded to reach out to different people,
so that I can balance my time while maintaining close relationships.

7. Getting Reminders to Reconnect
As a user who sometimes forgets to message friends,
I want to receive reminders when it’s been a while since we last talked,
so that I can stay in touch before too much time passes.

8. Sharing Memories With a Friend
As someone who values shared moments,
I want a space for each connection where I can post notes or photos,
so that I can remember our experiences together over time.

9. Finding a Specific Connection
As a user with many contacts,
I want to search or sort my list of connections,
so that I can easily find the person I’m thinking about.

10. Looking Back on My Interactions
As someone who cares about maintaining strong relationships,
I want to see when I last reached out to someone,
so that I can notice when it’s been too long and reconnect meaningfully.
